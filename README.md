# prism-connect
Reverse-engineered remote protocol and commands for PRISM Live Studio v4.0.0+.

This repository provides a Dart library to use the remote protocol, which is compatible with Flutter (uses `dart:io`, no web support). See `example/example.dart` for usage examples. If you wish to implement the protocol for yourself, [protocol documentation](https://github.com/entriphy/prism-connect/blob/main/protocol.md) is also provided.
